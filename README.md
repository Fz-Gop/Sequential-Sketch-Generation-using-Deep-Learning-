# Sequential Sketch Generation using Deep Learning

This project implements a **sequential generative model** to create human-like sketches conditioned on class names.  
The model leverages **LSTMs with attention** for stroke-by-stroke prediction, enabling the generation of sketches that resemble real human drawings.
